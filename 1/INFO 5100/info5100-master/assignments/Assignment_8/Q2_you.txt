I'M AMERICAN MADE BUD LIGHT CHEVROLET
MY MOMMA TAUGHT ME WRONG FROM RIGHT
I WAS BORN IN THE SOUTH
SOMETIMES I HAVE A BIG MOUTH
WHEN I SEE SOMETHING THAT I DON'T LIKE
I GOTTA SAY IT
WELL WE'VE BEEN DRIVING THIS ROAD
FOR A MIGHTY LONG TIME
PAYING NO MIND TO THE SIGNS
WELL THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S CHANGED
IT'S ALL BEEN REARRANGED
WE LEFT THAT DREAM SOMEWHERE BEHIND
SLOW DOWN YOU'RE GONNA CRASH
BABY YOU WERE SCREAMING
IT'S A BLAST BLAST BLAST
LOOK OUT BABE YOU GOT YOUR BLINDERS ON
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO GET REAL GONE
REAL GONE
REAL GONE
BUT THERE'S A NEW CAT IN TOWN
HE'S GOT HIGH PAID FRIENDS
THINKS HE'S GONNA CHANGE HISTORY
YOU THINK YOU KNOW HIM SO WELL
YEAH YOU THINK HE'S SO SWELL
BUT HE'S JUST PERPETUATING PROPHECY
COME ON NOW
SLOW DOWN YOU'RE GONNA CRASH
BABY YOU WERE SCREAMING
IT'S A BLAST BLAST BLAST
LOOK OUT YOU GOT YOUR BLINDERS ON
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO GET REAL GONE
REAL GONE
REAL GONE
REAL GONE
OH
WELL YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY IT AROUND HERE
CAUSE THEY'LL CATCH YOU AND GIVE YOU A WHIPPING
WELL I BELIEVE I WAS RIGHT
WHEN I SAID YOU WERE WRONG
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT
NOW DID YOU
SLOW DOWN YOU'RE GONNA CRASH
BABY YOU WERE SCREAMING
IT'S A BLAST BLAST BLAST
WELL LOOK OUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR BLINDERS ON
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO GET REAL GONE
WELL HERE I COME AND I'M SO NOT SCARED
GOT MY PEDAL TO THE METAL
GOT MY HANDS IN THE AIR
WELL LOOK OUT YOU TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO GET REAL GONE
REAL GONE
REAL GONE
OH
REAL GONE
REAL GONE
