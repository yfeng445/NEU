WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION
WE DON'T NEED NO THOUGHT CONTROL
NO DARK SARCASM IN THE CLASSROOM
TEACHERS LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
HEY TEACHERS LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
ALL IN ALL IT'S JUST ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
ALL IN ALL YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION
WE DON'T NEED NO THOUGHT CONTROL
NO DARK SARCASM IN THE CLASSROOM
TEACHERS LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
HEY TEACHERS LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
ALL IN ALL IT'S JUST ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
ALL IN ALL YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
