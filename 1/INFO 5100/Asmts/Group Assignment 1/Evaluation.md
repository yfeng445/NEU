#### Objectives

Design and prototype a system that will:

1. Utilize smartphones and IoT devices to collect real-time data on individuals' life events

2. Implement a life event scoring system (positive and negative)

3. Integrate personal data with the broader community-level information

4. Analyze the impact of individual events on family and overall community well-being

5. Identify patterns and potential root causes of urban issues

#### System design:

1. Data collection on smart phone and IoT device:
health data: heart rate, blood pressure. weight
sleeping data: sleep time, deep sleep time
activity data: move, exercise, stand

2. Life event scoring system:
give positive/negative weighted score based on the daliy events user have, for example:
Sudden increase in blood pressure = Negative score
Daily exercise completion = Positive score
Less than 5 hours of sleep = Negative score
The data would be stored in a time-related matrix

3. Data integration
