# AI-Based Wellness Scoring System Framework

This document outlines the framework for calculating wellness scores using AI techniques, focusing on data collection, weighted scoring, predictive modeling, and family and community-level adjustments.

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
### Objective
Aggregate and prepare data from various sources (Health Database, Life Event Database, Social Trend Database, etc.) for use in the wellness scoring system.

### Steps
- **Aggregate Data**: Collect data from relevant sources:
  - Health data (e.g., heart rate, sleep quality)
  - Life events (e.g., job change, health incidents)
  - Social trends and urban issues
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove missing values, handle outliers, and correct inconsistencies.
- **Normalization**: Standardize continuous variables (e.g., health metrics) to a common scale.
  - *Python Packages*: `pandas`, `sklearn.preprocessing` (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`)
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical data (e.g., event types) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or embeddings.
  - *Python Packages*: `sklearn.preprocessing` (e.g., `OneHotEncoder`)

## 2. Weighted Scoring Calculation
### Objective
Apply weights to different categories of inputs to calculate an initial wellness score.

### Steps
- **Define Weights**: Assign predefined weights to categories (e.g., 0.6 for health data, 0.3 for life events, 0.1 for social trends).
- **Calculate Individual Scores**: Multiply each input by its assigned weight. For example: Weighted Health Score = health_score * 0.6
- **Aggregate Weighted Scores**: Sum the weighted scores to get the initial wellness score.
- *Python Packages*: `numpy` for vectorized operations

## 3. Machine Learning for Predictive Scoring (Hugging Face)
### Objective
Use a machine learning model from Hugging Face to refine and predict the wellness score based on current inputs.

### Steps
- **Load Pre-Trained Model**: Utilize a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face that can be fine-tuned for regression tasks. For example, BERT-based models like `bert-base-uncased` can be adapted for regression by modifying the output layer.
- *Python Packages*: `transformers` from Hugging Face
- Example:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
  
  model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=1)  # For regression
  ```

- **Fine-Tune the Model**: Fine-tune the model on historical wellness score data to adapt it to the task of predicting wellness scores based on life events and health data. This step requires labeled training data where inputs (event and health descriptions) are paired with their corresponding wellness scores.
- *Python Packages*: `transformers`, `datasets`
- Example:
  ```python
  from datasets import load_dataset
  
  dataset = load_dataset('your_dataset')  # Replace with your dataset
  # Fine-tuning loop or trainer
  from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
  
  training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir='./results', num_train_epochs=3, per_device_train_batch_size=4,
      warmup_steps=500, weight_decay=0.01, logging_dir='./logs'
  )
  
  trainer = Trainer(
      model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset["train"], eval_dataset=dataset["test"]
  )
  trainer.train()
  ```

- **Predictive Adjustment**: Use the fine-tuned model to predict the impact of new data points on the wellness score. This model can take in text inputs describing life events and health conditions to output a score prediction.
- Example:
  ```python
  inputs = tokenizer("User had a high-stress event and poor sleep quality", return_tensors="pt")
  predicted_score = model(**inputs).logits.item()
  ```

- **Combine Predictions with Weighted Scores**: Adjust the initial wellness score by averaging it with the predictive modelâ€™s output: Refined Wellness Score = (Initial Wellness Score + Predicted Score) / 2

---

## 4. Family and Community-Level Adjustments
### Objective
Aggregate individual wellness scores to produce family and community-level scores, adjusting for broader trends.

### Steps
- **Family Score Calculation**: Average the wellness scores of all family members. Family Score = (Sum of Individual Wellness Scores) / (Number of Family Members)
- **Community Score Calculation**: Aggregate family scores and incorporate social trends.
Community Score = (Sum of Family Scores) / (Number of Families) + Adjustment Factor
- *Python Packages*: `numpy` for aggregation, `pandas` for data manipulation

---

## 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation
### Objective
Implement a feedback loop that adjusts the scoring model over time based on new data and patterns.

### Steps
- **Retraining the Model**: Periodically retrain the Hugging Face model with updated data to ensure accuracy. This can be done by saving and loading the model using the `save_pretrained` and `from_pretrained` methods.
- *Python Packages*: `transformers`, `datasets`
- **Adaptive Weight Adjustment**: Adjust category weights dynamically based on recent performance and correlations.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to refine scoring mechanisms over time.

## 6. Score Output and Reporting
### Objective
Output the final wellness scores and provide visualization tools for trend analysis.

### Steps
- **Store the Calculated Scores**: Write final scores to databases for individual, family, and community levels.
- **Generate Reports**: Visualize wellness scores over time for users and city officials.
- *Python Packages*: `pandas` for data storage, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
